## Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

### Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:

1) Functional Requirements:
* System should show all the books which are available in library
* All books should be categarised according to their subject . So it will became easier for user for search .
* All the authorised users should be able to transact books while sitting at their comfort.
* The Librarian should know all the information about issueing and receving of books.
* Librarian  should be able to add new books in system and also delete
* Librarian should be able to see history of all the transactions
* The system should work only when a person is connected to institute's LAN network.
* If a person borrowes a book then he should be able to see its due date.
* A person can extend its due date in case there are no prior bookings for that book.
* If the book is already issued then he can select option for advance booking.
* Any non authorised member should able to search the book but not able to do transaction.
* There should be a different login option for Librarian , Authorised users and guest users.
* If a person forgets to return book before it's due date than he should get be peanalised.
* Staff of library should have privileged access.




2) Non- Functional Requirements:
* I. Availibity - System should be availabe 24x7 so that user can access any point of time. 
* II. Portability - The system should run on all the devices with same efficiency.
* III. Reusability - The interface should be designed in such a way that a new user doesn't find it difficult to figure it out.
* IV.  Role based Security - It should have a clear sepration between the user login and librarian login so that no data a user doesn't get access to any personal data. There should be clear abstraction in terms of privilages offered to user and staff members.
* V.   Quality  - The software should be running fast and smooth even in case of large number of issues/return requests. Even in case of system failure the system should be able to recover it's data and complete transaction which were left incomplete.
* VI.  Safety - Personal data should be encrypted before storing in database.





### Q.2
A) Scope:
    In the world around 5% of population which is about 466 milion , suffers from hearing disablities. To help them and make their life easier we will design a mobile application which will detect vehicle horn , baby crying and in machine working. To identify sound events like baby crying and automobile horns, our smartphone app will use artificial intelligence. This software is designed for Android to use less bandwidth and operate instantly.


B) Functional Requirements:

* User shoul be able to login into the app and continue logging in for long use untill sign out intensionally.
* To identify important sounds, it employs artificial intelligence. For instance, he may activate the road crossing mode, which would send alert signals whenever a car close honked. It should detect sounds and respond within a fraction of seconds.
* Displays alerts to users after sound detection. Example get alert signal if a baby is crying nearby.
* For prolonged use, apps need less power and have low latency.
* The app's predictions ought to be correct.
* In urgent instances, it should prompt the user to respond; if there is no answer, alerts should be sent to family members and friends whose information has been submitted and location of the user should be traced by the app in case of emergency situations.

C) Non Functional Requirements:

* I. Availibity - System should be availabe 24x7 so that user can use it any point of time. 
* II. Portability - The system should run on all the devices with any Operating System with same efficiency.
* III. Reusability - The interface should be designed in such a way that a new user doesn't find it difficult to understand and learn using it.
* IV. Quality  - The software should be running fast and smooth even in case low latency/bandwidth. 
* V. Safety - Personal data should be encrypted before storing in database.
* VI.Security - The system shouldn't get hacked easily and send malicious signals to user.
