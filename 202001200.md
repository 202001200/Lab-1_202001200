## Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

## Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:

1) Functional Requirements:
* System should show all the books which are available in library
* All books should be categarised according to their subject . So it will became easier for user for search .
* All the authorised users should be able to transact books while sitting at their comfort.
* The Librarian should know all the information about issueing and receving of books.
* Librarian  should be able to add new books in system and also delete
* Librarian should be able to see history of all the transactions
* The system should work only when a person is connected to institute's LAN network.
* If a person borrowes a book then he should be able to see its due date.
* A person can extend its due date in case there are no prior bookings for that book.
* If the book is already issued then he can select option for advance booking.
* Any non authorised member should able to search the book but not able to do transaction.
* There should be a different login option for Librarian , Authorised users and guest users.
* If a person forgets to return book before it's due date than he should get be peanalised.
* Staff of library should have privileged access.




2) Non- Functional Requirements:
* I. Availibity - System should be availabe 24x7 so that user can access any point of time. 
* II. Portability - The system should run on all the devices with same efficiency.
* III. Reusability - The interface should be designed in such a way that a new user doesn't find it difficult to figure it out.
* IV.  Role based Security - It should have a clear sepration between the user login and librarian login so that no data a user doesn't get access to any personal data.
* V.   Quality  - The software should be running fast and smooth even in case of large number of issues/return requests. Even in case of system failure the system should be able to recover it's data and complete transaction which were left incomplete.
* VI.  Safety - Personal data should be encrypted before storing in database.
